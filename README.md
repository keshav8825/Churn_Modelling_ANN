Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting churn is essential for businesses to identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to retain them.
In this project, we use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to analyze historical customer data and predict the likelihood of churn for each customer. The ANN model is trained on a dataset containing various features such as customer demographics, account information, and transaction history.
